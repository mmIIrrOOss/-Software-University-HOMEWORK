Implementation of an application that shows us the prices and types of properties in the city of Sofia.

The application is written in C# .NET 5.0.
MS SQL SERVER is used as database.
The data is on imot.bg in the form of Json files.

Functionality involves several things. Models, importers and services.

Coming soon from a web console app.
